# Feature Specification: Coze Python SDK Integration

**Feature Branch**: `006-use-context7-and`
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "use context7 and fetch https://github.com/coze-dev/coze-py, explore how to add coze py sdk in api/, recently i add dify sdk in api/pyproject.toml and add comprehensive api/tests/dify/ with dify python sdk, you should follow this pattern to integrate coze py sdk."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - SDK Installation and Configuration (Priority: P1)

Developers can install and configure the Coze Python SDK in the backend API to enable integration with Coze AI services.

**Why this priority**: Foundation for all Coze functionality - without SDK installation and configuration, no other features can work. This establishes the basic infrastructure.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying SDK installation in pyproject.toml, confirming package is importable, and validating authentication configuration through environment variables.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** pyproject.toml exists, **When** Coze SDK dependency is added, **Then** the SDK package (cozepy) is listed in dependencies
2. **Given** SDK is installed, **When** importing cozepy in Python code, **Then** import succeeds without errors
3. **Given** environment variables are configured, **When** initializing Coze client, **Then** client authenticates successfully with provided credentials

---

### User Story 2 - Basic Coze Client Functionality Testing (Priority: P2)

Developers can verify core Coze SDK client operations work correctly through comprehensive unit tests covering synchronous and asynchronous clients.

**Why this priority**: Ensures SDK integration is functioning correctly and provides code examples for future development. Builds on P1 installation foundation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by running pytest suite that validates client initialization, authentication patterns, and basic client properties using mocks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** test fixtures for API credentials, **When** tests execute client initialization, **Then** both sync and async clients initialize with correct authentication
2. **Given** mock responses configured, **When** tests verify client properties, **Then** API key, base URL, and authentication methods are accessible and correct
3. **Given** test suite configured, **When** running pytest, **Then** all client initialization tests pass without errors

---

### User Story 3 - Bot Operations Testing (Priority: P3)

Developers can test bot-related operations including listing bots, retrieving bot details, and managing bot workspaces through comprehensive test coverage.

**Why this priority**: Tests primary Coze functionality for bot management, which is the core use case for the Coze platform. Depends on working client from P2.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running bot-specific test suite that validates list operations, retrieval operations, and workspace queries using mocked API responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** workspace ID provided, **When** listing bots with pagination, **Then** returns paginated bot list with correct page numbers and items
2. **Given** bot ID provided, **When** retrieving bot details, **Then** returns bot information with metadata and logid for debugging
3. **Given** mock API responses, **When** testing bot operations, **Then** all HTTP requests use correct endpoints and authentication headers

---

### User Story 4 - Chat and Conversation Testing (Priority: P3)

Developers can test chat functionality including both synchronous and streaming chat messages, conversation management, and message operations.

**Why this priority**: Validates the interactive chat capabilities of Coze bots, essential for conversational AI features. Same priority as bot operations since both are core features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested through dedicated chat test suite covering message creation, streaming responses, conversation management, and event handling with mocked responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** bot ID and user message, **When** creating chat in blocking mode, **Then** returns complete response with token usage statistics
2. **Given** bot ID and user message, **When** streaming chat, **Then** yields events for message deltas and completion with proper event types
3. **Given** conversation ID, **When** managing conversation (create/retrieve/delete), **Then** operations succeed with appropriate API calls and responses
4. **Given** chat stream events, **When** processing event types, **Then** correctly handles CONVERSATION_MESSAGE_DELTA and CONVERSATION_CHAT_COMPLETED events

---

### User Story 5 - Workflow Operations Testing (Priority: P4)

Developers can test Coze workflow execution including running workflows, retrieving results, and accessing workflow logs with various filters.

**Why this priority**: Workflow functionality is an advanced feature that builds upon basic chat capabilities. Lower priority than core chat/bot features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested via workflow-specific test suite validating workflow execution modes (blocking/streaming), result retrieval, and log filtering with mocked API responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** workflow ID and inputs, **When** executing workflow in blocking mode, **Then** returns workflow results with execution status and output data
2. **Given** workflow ID and inputs, **When** executing workflow in streaming mode, **Then** streams workflow progress and results incrementally
3. **Given** workflow run ID, **When** retrieving workflow results, **Then** returns complete execution details and output
4. **Given** filter parameters (status, date range, keywords), **When** querying workflow logs, **Then** returns filtered log entries matching criteria

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Coze API token is invalid or expired during client initialization?
- How does the system handle network errors or timeouts when making Coze API calls?
- What happens when SDK version conflicts occur with other dependencies in pyproject.toml?
- How does the system handle rate limiting from Coze API endpoints?
- What happens when workspace ID or bot ID doesn't exist or is inaccessible?
- How does streaming chat handle connection interruptions or partial event data?
- What happens when workflow execution exceeds timeout limits?
- How does the system handle malformed event data in streaming responses?
