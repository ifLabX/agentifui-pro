# Implementation Plan: Coze Python SDK Integration

**Branch**: `006-use-context7-and` | **Date**: 2025-10-10 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/006-use-context7-and/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Integrate the Coze Python SDK (cozepy) into the backend API following the established Dify SDK integration pattern. The implementation focuses on comprehensive test coverage for SDK client operations including bot management, chat functionality (synchronous and streaming), conversation management, and workflow execution. All tests will use mocks to avoid real API calls, ensuring fast, reliable test execution. The integration provides developers with working examples of Coze SDK usage while maintaining 80% test coverage and strict type checking compliance.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12+ (required by project pyproject.toml)
**Primary Dependencies**: cozepy (Coze Python SDK), pytest 7.0+, pytest-asyncio 0.21+, httpx (for mocking), unittest.mock
**Storage**: N/A (test-only integration, no persistent storage required)
**Testing**: pytest with pytest-asyncio for async test support, unittest.mock for mocking HTTP calls
**Target Platform**: Backend API (api/ directory), Linux/macOS development environments
**Project Type**: Web (monorepo with backend API component)
**Performance Goals**: Test suite execution < 5 seconds (mocked, no real API calls), 30+ test cases
**Constraints**: 80% minimum test coverage, zero flaky tests, mypy strict mode compliance, no real Coze API calls
**Scale/Scope**: Comprehensive SDK coverage (client initialization, bot operations, chat/conversation, workflows), test organization mirroring Dify SDK pattern (api/tests/dify/)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

- [x] **Monorepo Consistency**: N/A - Backend-only feature, no frontend coordination required
- [x] **Type Safety**: All test code will use Python type hints for function signatures and mock objects
- [x] **Test-First**: Feature IS test implementation - tests written to validate SDK integration patterns
- [x] **English-Only**: All code, comments, docstrings, and commit messages will be in English
- [x] **Convention**: Follows snake_case for Python modules/functions, PascalCase for test classes

*Violations must be justified in Complexity Tracking section below.*

```

**Structure Decision**: Backend-only test implementation following the established Dify SDK pattern. All tests located in `api/tests/coze/` directory, mirroring the organization of `api/tests/dify/`. No source code changes required - this is purely a test suite addition to validate SDK integration patterns and provide usage examples for developers.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No constitution violations - all checks passed.
## Phase 0: Research (COMPLETE)

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Artifacts**: research.md

All technical unknowns resolved through Context7 documentation analysis and Dify SDK pattern review:
- SDK installation method determined (pip install cozepy)
- Mocking strategy defined (httpx mocking with unittest.mock)
- Test structure designed (mirror Dify pattern with 4 test modules)
- Fixture requirements identified (auth, responses, entities, sample data)
- Async testing approach planned (pytest-asyncio)
- Event handling patterns documented (streaming chat events)
- Type checking compliance strategy established (mypy strict mode)

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts (COMPLETE)

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Artifacts**: data-model.md, contracts/test-contracts.md, quickstart.md

Design artifacts created:
- **data-model.md**: Defines 8 test entities (Client Config, Bot, Chat, Message, Event, Workflow, HTTP Response, Pagination) with validation rules and fixture patterns
- **contracts/test-contracts.md**: Specifies test module contracts, mock API interaction requirements, type checking standards, and compliance validation
- **quickstart.md**: Provides 15-minute developer onboarding guide with commands, examples, and troubleshooting

**Agent Context Updated**: CLAUDE.md updated with Coze SDK technology stack

## Phase 2: Tasks Generation

**Status**: ⏳ Pending
**Command**: Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate tasks.md with implementation tasks

Phase 2 will create dependency-ordered task breakdown for:
1. pyproject.toml dependency update
2. Test fixture creation (conftest.py)
3. Client initialization tests
4. Bot operations tests
5. Chat and conversation tests  
6. Workflow execution tests
7. Test documentation (README.md)
8. Coverage and quality validation

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review Planning Artifacts**:
   - Verify research.md covers all technical decisions
   - Review data-model.md for test entity completeness
   - Check contracts/test-contracts.md for test requirements
   - Read quickstart.md for implementation guidance

2. **Generate Implementation Tasks**:
   - Run `/speckit.tasks` to create tasks.md
   - Tasks will be dependency-ordered and ready for execution

3. **Begin Implementation**:
   - Follow tasks.md sequentially
   - Reference quickstart.md for patterns and examples
   - Maintain test-first approach per constitution

## Implementation Summary

**What Was Planned**:
- Coze Python SDK integration test suite mirroring Dify pattern
- Comprehensive test coverage (30+ tests, 80%+ coverage)
- Type-safe mocking patterns with httpx
- Support for sync/async clients, streaming, pagination
- Full documentation for developer onboarding

**Key Decisions**:
- Use unittest.mock for HTTP mocking (consistent with Dify)
- Organize tests by SDK client type (Coze, Bot, Chat, Workflow)
- Create extensive fixtures in conftest.py for reusability
- Test both blocking and streaming modes for chat/workflows
- Include logid verification for debugging support

**Quality Standards**:
- 80% minimum test coverage
- mypy strict mode compliance
- Zero flaky tests
- Execution time < 5 seconds (mocked)
- Comprehensive docstrings (Given/When/Then format)

**Architecture Patterns**:
- Mirror Dify SDK test structure for consistency
- Use factory fixtures for dynamic test data generation
- Parametrize tests for multiple scenarios
- Separate test classes by operation category
