# Specification Quality Checklist: Update Dify SDK Test Suite for httpx Migration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **Pass** - Specification focuses on "WHAT" developers need (passing tests, working mocks) without specifying "HOW" to implement httpx mocking patterns.
✅ **Pass** - Written from developer perspective (the user of the test suite) focusing on test reliability and maintainability.
✅ **Pass** - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete and well-structured.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **Pass** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All requirements are specific and unambiguous.
✅ **Pass** - Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., "All seven test files MUST pass successfully" can be verified by running pytest).
✅ **Pass** - Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (100% success rate, 80% coverage, 10% execution time).
✅ **Pass** - Success criteria focus on outcomes (tests passing, no import errors) not implementation (httpx API usage).
✅ **Pass** - Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format and cover key workflows.
✅ **Pass** - Edge cases identify important scenarios (error responses, streaming, exceptions).
✅ **Pass** - Scope is bounded with clear "Out of Scope" section excluding SDK migration, documentation updates, etc.
✅ **Pass** - Dependencies (dify-python-sdk, httpx, pytest) and assumptions (synchronous httpx, fixture-based testing) are documented.

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **Pass** - All 9 functional requirements map to acceptance criteria in user stories.
✅ **Pass** - User scenarios cover both immediate fix (P1: existing tests pass) and future usage (P2: new tests follow patterns).
✅ **Pass** - Measurable outcomes defined: 100% test success, no import errors, coverage maintained, execution time preserved.
✅ **Pass** - Specification avoids implementation details like specific httpx API calls or mock object construction.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, testable, and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

## Notes

- This is a technical migration specification where "users" are developers maintaining the test suite
- The specification correctly identifies the root cause (SDK upgraded from requests to httpx) and desired outcome (tests pass with new SDK)
- Edge cases appropriately cover httpx-specific concerns (streaming, exceptions, error handling)
- Success criteria include both functional (tests pass) and non-functional (execution time, coverage) metrics
- Assumptions section provides important context about synchronous httpx usage and fixture patterns
