# Feature Specification: FastAPI Backend Architecture Refactoring

**Feature Branch**: `004-refactor-spec-md`
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "@REFACTOR_SPEC.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Refactoring specification document provided
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: code reorganization, zero functionality changes, FastAPI best practices alignment
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí None - specification is comprehensive and explicit
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer workflow scenarios for refactoring process
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are about structural changes, not behavioral changes
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí No new data entities - only code module reorganization
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation-specific tech choices (refactoring inherits existing stack)
   ‚Üí No ambiguities present
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT the new structure achieves and WHY it's better
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement specific file moves (that's in the plan)
- üë• Written for developers understanding project maintainability goals

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a backend developer maintaining the FastAPI application, I need the codebase organized according to FastAPI best practices so that I can quickly locate related code, understand module responsibilities, and maintain clear separation between infrastructure, data models, and API contracts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the refactoring is complete, **When** a developer needs to modify database connection logic, **Then** they find all database infrastructure in `core/db.py` instead of scattered across multiple `database/` files
2. **Given** the refactoring is complete, **When** a developer adds a new API endpoint, **Then** they place Pydantic schemas in `schemas/` and SQLAlchemy models in `models/` with clear separation
3. **Given** the refactoring is complete, **When** the test suite runs, **Then** all 106 existing tests pass with 97%+ coverage maintained
4. **Given** the refactoring is complete, **When** imports are verified, **Then** no old import paths remain (`from config.settings`, `from database.*`, `from health.*`)
5. **Given** the refactoring is complete, **When** the application starts, **Then** it initializes successfully with identical runtime behavior to pre-refactor state

### Edge Cases
- What happens when old directories are removed before new structure is verified? ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Cleanup only happens in Phase 6 after complete verification
- How does system handle import conflicts during transition? ‚Üí **Mitigation**: New files created first with new imports, old files deleted only after tests pass
- What if tests fail after refactoring? ‚Üí **Rollback**: Entire branch can be abandoned via `git checkout main` with zero impact

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Structural Organization
- **FR-001**: System MUST reorganize codebase to follow FastAPI official project structure recommendations
- **FR-002**: System MUST consolidate configuration management into single `core/config.py` module (from `config/settings.py`)
- **FR-003**: System MUST consolidate database infrastructure into single `core/db.py` module (from `database/connection.py` + `database/session.py`)
- **FR-004**: System MUST separate Pydantic API schemas into `schemas/` directory (from `health/models.py`)
- **FR-005**: System MUST organize API endpoints under `api/endpoints/` directory (from `health/endpoints.py`)
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain existing `middleware/` and `models/` directories unchanged in location

#### Import Path Updates
- **FR-007**: System MUST update all import statements from old paths to new paths according to migration mapping table
- **FR-008**: System MUST update imports in `main.py`, `middleware/error_handler.py`, and all test files
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure no old import paths remain after refactoring (`from config.settings`, `from database.*`, `from health.*`)

#### Zero Functionality Changes
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain 100% identical API endpoint paths (e.g., `/health`, `/health/db` unchanged)
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain 100% identical request/response formats for all endpoints
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain 100% identical application behavior and runtime characteristics
- **FR-013**: System MUST NOT add new features, dependencies, or configuration changes
- **FR-014**: System MUST NOT modify database schema or migration files

#### Quality Preservation
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain all 106 existing tests passing with 100% success rate
- **FR-016**: System MUST maintain test coverage at 97% or higher
- **FR-017**: System MUST pass all linting checks (ruff) with no new errors
- **FR-018**: System MUST maintain all existing code quality standards

#### Verification Requirements
- **FR-019**: System MUST verify no old import paths remain via grep checks before cleanup
- **FR-020**: System MUST verify all new modules are importable via Python import tests
- **FR-021**: System MUST verify application startup succeeds without errors
- **FR-022**: System MUST complete all verification steps in Phase 5 before proceeding to Phase 6 cleanup

#### Cleanup Safety
- **FR-023**: System MUST remove old directories (`config/`, `database/`, `health/`) ONLY after all verification passes
- **FR-024**: System MUST maintain rollback capability via git branch isolation

### Key Entities *(code module reorganization)*
- **core/config.py**: Application configuration management (Settings class, environment variable handling)
- **core/db.py**: Database infrastructure (engine, connection pooling, session factory, dispose logic)
- **schemas/**: Pydantic models for API validation and serialization (request/response contracts)
- **api/endpoints/**: API route handlers organized by domain (health endpoints, future feature endpoints)
- **api/deps.py**: Shared dependency functions for dependency injection (re-exports, no new logic)
- **models/**: SQLAlchemy ORM models representing database tables (unchanged location)
- **middleware/**: ASGI middleware components (unchanged location)
