# Research: Backend Foundation Architecture

## FastAPI Project Structure Best Practices

**Decision**: Follow clean architecture with layered separation (api/, core/, db/, services/, schemas/)
**Rationale**:
- Enables clear separation of concerns and maintainability
- Supports future scaling with modular components
- Aligns with FastAPI community best practices and enterprise patterns
**Alternatives considered**:
- Flat structure: Rejected due to poor scalability
- Domain-driven design: Too complex for foundation setup

## SQLAlchemy 2.0 Integration

**Decision**: Use SQLAlchemy 2.0 with async sessions and declarative base
**Rationale**:
- Latest SQLAlchemy version with improved type hints and async support
- Better performance with async/await patterns
- Future-proof API design
**Alternatives considered**:
- SQLAlchemy 1.x: Rejected due to legacy status and missing async features
- Alternative ORMs: Rejected to maintain ecosystem consistency

## Alembic Configuration

**Decision**: Configure Alembic with automatic model discovery and UUIDv7 support
**Rationale**:
- Automated migration generation reduces manual errors
- UUIDv7 provides time-ordered UUIDs for better database performance
- Supports team development with migration versioning
**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual migrations: Rejected due to maintenance overhead
- UUID4: Rejected in favor of UUIDv7 for better clustering

## Development Environment Setup

**Decision**: Use uv for dependency management with development/production environment separation
**Rationale**:
- uv provides faster dependency resolution and installation
- Already established in the monorepo setup
- Better lock file management than pip
**Alternatives considered**:
- Poetry: Rejected to maintain consistency with existing project setup
- pip-tools: Rejected due to slower performance compared to uv

## Error Handling and Logging

**Decision**: Implement structured error handling with custom exception classes and centralized error handlers
**Rationale**:
- Provides consistent API error responses
- Enables proper error tracking and debugging
- Supports future observability requirements
**Alternatives considered**:
- Default FastAPI error handling: Insufficient for production requirements
- External error tracking only: Rejected due to dependency on external services

## Configuration Management

**Decision**: Use Pydantic Settings for environment-based configuration with validation
**Rationale**:
- Type-safe configuration with automatic validation
- Seamless integration with FastAPI and Pydantic ecosystem
- Support for multiple environment configurations
**Alternatives considered**:
- Python-decouple: Rejected due to less type safety
- Environment variables only: Rejected due to lack of validation and structure

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Use pytest with FastAPI TestClient and async test support
**Rationale**:
- Native FastAPI testing support with TestClient
- Async test capabilities for database testing
- Rich ecosystem of pytest plugins
**Alternatives considered**:
- unittest: Rejected due to less flexible fixture system
- httpx directly: Rejected due to additional complexity

## CORS and Security

**Decision**: Configure CORS for Next.js frontend integration with security-first defaults
**Rationale**:
- Required for monorepo frontend-backend communication
- Security-conscious configuration prevents common vulnerabilities
- Easy to adjust for different deployment environments
**Alternatives considered**:
- Open CORS: Rejected due to security risks
- No CORS handling: Rejected due to frontend integration requirements
