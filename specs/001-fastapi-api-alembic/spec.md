# Feature Specification: Backend Foundation Architecture

**Feature Branch**: `001-fastapi-api-alembic`
**Created**: 2025-01-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a basic backend architecture using FastAPI in the api/ directory, following best practices with Alembic and SQLAlchemy 2.0 setup"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: FastAPI backend foundation with Alembic + SQLAlchemy 2.0
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developers, System administrators
   ‚Üí Actions: Create backend foundation, Setup database migrations, Configure project structure
   ‚Üí Data: Configuration files, Database schemas, Project scaffolding
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must use FastAPI, Alembic, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Located in api/ directory
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No major ambiguities for foundation setup
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: Developer sets up development environment
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on foundation capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Configuration entities, Database connection entities
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Foundation setup is well-defined
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the AgentifUI-Pro project, I need a properly configured backend foundation so that I can start building application features on a solid, maintainable architecture that follows industry best practices.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh project environment, **When** a developer clones the repository and follows setup instructions, **Then** they can start the development server successfully
2. **Given** the backend foundation is configured, **When** a developer creates a new database migration, **Then** Alembic properly manages the schema changes
3. **Given** the project structure is established, **When** a developer adds new API endpoints, **Then** they follow the established patterns and conventions
4. **Given** the development environment is running, **When** code quality tools are executed, **Then** they pass without configuration issues

### Edge Cases
- What happens when database connection fails during startup?
- How does the system handle missing environment variables?
- What occurs when migration conflicts arise in team development?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a FastAPI application foundation located in the api/ directory
- **FR-002**: System MUST include Alembic configuration for database migration management
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement SQLAlchemy 2.0 with proper session management
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide development server startup capabilities with hot reload
- **FR-005**: System MUST include code quality tools (linting, formatting) integration
- **FR-006**: System MUST support environment-based configuration management
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide database initialization and migration scripts
- **FR-008**: System MUST include proper Python dependency management using uv
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear project structure following FastAPI best practices
- **FR-010**: System MUST include basic error handling and exception management foundation
- **FR-011**: System MUST support PostgreSQL database connectivity with UUIDv7 primary keys
- **FR-012**: System MUST include CORS configuration for frontend integration

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Application Configuration**: Environment variables, database settings, security configurations
- **Database Connection**: SQLAlchemy engine, session factory, connection pooling
- **Migration Management**: Alembic versions, schema evolution tracking
- **Project Structure**: Modular organization supporting scalable development
