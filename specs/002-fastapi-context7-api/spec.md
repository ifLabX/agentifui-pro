# Feature Specification: FastAPI Backend Architecture Optimization and Database Configuration Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `002-fastapi-context7-api`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "The current branch is an initial backend architecture setup branch. However, the architecture needs adjustments based on this foundation. You need to combine FastAPI best practices, such as using context7 after obtaining it, to see how to configure the database. The current database configuration and parsing have some issues. It may not be flexible and automated enough. For example, look at the url in @api/.env.example. Normally, fields should be split and then concatenated, and environment variables should preferably not use [] brackets - just use comma separation. Also, regarding the overall backend architecture, you can analyze the current architecture @api/ and provide detailed approaches. The task is backend optimization and database configuration flexibility while ensuring proper database activation."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Current backend architecture has initial setup but needs restructuring
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: database config flexibility, environment variable format, architecture optimization, FastAPI best practices
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Database field composition strategy needs clarification
   ‚Üí Specific architecture pain points require investigation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Development team deploying across environments, database connection management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on configuration flexibility and architectural improvements
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Database connection components, configuration settings, application architecture modules
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Specification addresses technical architecture without implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT the backend architecture needs to achieve and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no specific code structures, specific libraries beyond FastAPI)
- üë• Written for technical stakeholders who need improved development and deployment experience

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Development teams need a flexible, maintainable FastAPI backend architecture that supports multiple deployment environments with simplified database configuration management. The current architecture lacks flexibility in database connection setup and doesn't follow FastAPI best practices for scalable applications.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new development environment, **When** a developer sets up the database connection, **Then** they can configure it using individual environment variables that are automatically composed into connection strings
2. **Given** different deployment environments (dev/staging/prod), **When** environment variables are set using comma-separated values, **Then** the system correctly parses and applies these configurations without requiring JSON array formats
3. **Given** a production deployment, **When** database connection issues occur, **Then** the system provides clear diagnostic information and graceful error handling
4. **Given** the current backend codebase, **When** following FastAPI architectural best practices, **Then** the code structure supports maintainability, testing, and scalability

### Edge Cases
- What happens when individual database connection components are missing or invalid?
- How does the system handle database connection failures during application startup?
- What occurs when environment variables contain unexpected formats or special characters?
- How does the configuration system behave when transitioning between development and production environments?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support flexible database configuration through individual environment variables (host, port, username, password, database name) that are automatically composed into connection strings
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse comma-separated environment variable values without requiring JSON array bracket notation
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate database connection parameters and provide clear error messages for invalid configurations
- **FR-004**: System MUST establish reliable database connections with proper connection pooling and timeout handling
- **FR-005**: System MUST follow FastAPI architectural best practices for dependency injection, settings management, and application structure
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide database health checking capabilities that can verify connection status and provide diagnostic information
- **FR-007**: System MUST support environment-specific configuration profiles (development, staging, production) with appropriate defaults and validation rules
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle database connection lifecycle management including proper startup, shutdown, and error recovery procedures
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide configuration validation that prevents common deployment errors and security issues
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing environment variable formats during transition period

### Key Entities
- **Database Configuration**: Represents connection parameters including host, port, credentials, database name, and connection pool settings
- **Environment Settings**: Encompasses all application configuration including server settings, feature flags, logging configuration, and security parameters
- **Connection Manager**: Manages database connection lifecycle, health monitoring, and connection pool optimization
- **Application Architecture**: Overall backend structure including modules, dependencies, middleware, and service organization
