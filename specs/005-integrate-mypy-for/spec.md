## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the Python backend codebase, I need automatic type checking to catch type-related errors before code execution, so that I can prevent runtime bugs, improve code maintainability, and ensure consistent type usage across the project.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I write Python code with type annotations, **When** I run the type checker, **Then** it validates all type annotations against actual usage and reports any mismatches

2. **Given** I attempt to pass a wrong type to a function, **When** the type checker runs, **Then** it reports an error showing the expected type versus the actual type

3. **Given** I write code without proper type annotations, **When** the type checker runs in strict mode, **Then** it reports missing type annotations as errors

4. **Given** I work with asynchronous code patterns, **When** the type checker analyzes the code, **Then** it correctly validates async/await patterns and coroutine types

5. **Given** I use third-party libraries without type information, **When** the type checker runs, **Then** it handles missing type stubs gracefully without blocking development

6. **Given** I commit code changes, **When** the pre-commit hook executes, **Then** the type checker validates my changes before allowing the commit

7. **Given** the CI/CD pipeline runs, **When** it reaches the type checking stage, **Then** it fails the build if type errors are detected

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a library provides incomplete or incorrect type information?
- How does the system handle gradual typing when migrating existing untyped code?
- What happens when type checking conflicts with dynamic Python features?
- How does the system handle performance when checking large codebases?
- What happens when developers need to temporarily bypass strict type checking for valid reasons?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST validate all type annotations in Python source code against actual usage patterns
- **FR-002**: System MUST report type mismatches with clear error messages showing file location, line number, expected type, and actual type
- **FR-003**: System MUST enforce strict type checking rules including requiring type annotations for all function signatures
- **FR-004**: System MUST correctly validate asynchronous code patterns including async/await, coroutines, and async generators
- **FR-005**: System MUST integrate with the development workflow by running automatically before code commits
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate with CI/CD pipeline to block merges when type errors are detected
- **FR-007**: System MUST cache type checking results to improve performance on subsequent runs
- **FR-008**: System MUST support per-module configuration to handle third-party libraries without type information
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide incremental checking to only validate changed files and their dependencies
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate generic types and type parameters correctly
- **FR-011**: System MUST support conditional type exclusions for generated code and migration scripts
- **FR-012**: System MUST detect unreachable code and redundant type casts
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate that optional types (None values) are handled safely throughout the codebase

### Key Entities

- **Type Checking Configuration**: Defines strictness level, enabled checks, excluded paths, and per-module overrides for the type checking system
- **Type Error Report**: Contains file path, line number, column number, error code, error message, expected type, and actual type for each detected type mismatch
- **Type Cache**: Stores previously computed type information to accelerate subsequent type checking runs
- **Check Result**: Contains overall pass/fail status, count of errors found, count of files checked, and execution time for each type checking run
