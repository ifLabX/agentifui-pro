# Research: FastAPI Backend Architecture Foundation

**Date**: 2025-09-23
**Phase**: Phase 0 Research
**Status**: Complete

## Research Findings

### 1. PostgreSQL 18 UUIDv7 Integration Patterns

**Decision**: Plan for PostgreSQL 18 UUIDv7 support with UUID4 fallback
**Rationale**: PostgreSQL 18 introduces native `uuidv7()` function with time-ordered, monotonic properties ideal for primary keys. Release anticipated September/October 2025, making it available for production use.
**Alternatives considered**:
- pg_uuidv7 extension for earlier PostgreSQL versions
- Python-generated UUIDv7 values via `uuid7` package
- Stick with UUID4 indefinitely

**Implementation approach**:
- Configure SQLAlchemy models with UUID primary keys using generic UUID type
- Create database function wrapper to use `uuidv7()` when available, fallback to `gen_random_uuid()`
- Alembic migration to switch from UUID4 to UUIDv7 when PostgreSQL 18 is deployed

### 2. SQLAlchemy 2.0 Async Best Practices with FastAPI

**Decision**: Use SQLAlchemy 2.0 async engine with asyncpg driver and session-per-request pattern
**Rationale**: SQLAlchemy 2.0 provides mature async support with `create_async_engine()`, `AsyncSession`, and proper connection pooling. AsyncPG driver offers the best performance for PostgreSQL async operations.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Synchronous SQLAlchemy with thread pool
- SQLModel (overkill for foundation architecture)
- Raw asyncpg without ORM

**Key patterns identified**:
```python
# Engine creation with asyncpg
engine = create_async_engine("postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host/db")

# Session dependency for FastAPI
async def get_db_session():
    async with AsyncSession(engine) as session:
        yield session

# Proper async context management
async with engine.connect() as conn:
    result = await conn.execute(text("SELECT 1"))
```

### 3. Alembic Configuration for Async Environments

**Decision**: Configure Alembic with async support for SQLAlchemy 2.0 integration
**Rationale**: Alembic supports async engines since version 1.7+, allowing seamless integration with async SQLAlchemy setup. Critical for maintaining consistency between application and migration environments.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate sync connection for migrations only
- Manual migration scripts without Alembic
- Django-style migrations

**Configuration requirements**:
- `alembic.ini` configured with async database URL
- `env.py` using `run_async_migrations()` for async context
- Migration templates supporting both sync and async operations
- Connection sharing between app and migration contexts

### 4. RLS-Ready Database Architecture Patterns

**Decision**: Design schema with future RLS support without immediate implementation
**Rationale**: Row Level Security requires careful table design and security policies. Foundation should enable RLS without forcing immediate implementation complexity.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Implement RLS immediately (violates minimal requirement)
- Ignore RLS considerations (makes future implementation difficult)
- Application-level security only

**RLS preparation patterns**:
- Include user/tenant context in base model design
- Ensure all tables can support row-level filtering
- Design connection/session patterns that can pass security context
- Avoid architectural decisions that conflict with RLS requirements

### 5. FastAPI + SQLAlchemy Integration Architecture

**Decision**: Dependency injection pattern with async session management
**Rationale**: FastAPI's dependency injection system provides clean separation of concerns and proper resource lifecycle management for database sessions.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual session management in endpoints
- Context manager approach without dependencies
- Global session objects

**Architecture components**:
- Database configuration management via environment variables
- Connection pool configuration for async operations
- Health check endpoints for monitoring database connectivity
- Graceful error handling for database connection failures
- Session dependency injection for clean request lifecycle

## Technology Stack Decisions

| Component | Choice | Version | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **ORM** | SQLAlchemy | 2.0+ | Mature async support, strong typing, migration compatibility |
| **Database Driver** | asyncpg | latest | Best PostgreSQL async performance, native prepared statements |
| **Migration Tool** | Alembic | latest | Official SQLAlchemy migration tool, async support |
| **Configuration** | Pydantic Settings | 2.0+ | Type-safe environment variable handling |
| **Testing** | pytest + pytest-asyncio | latest | Async test support, FastAPI test client integration |

## Implementation Readiness Assessment

### Immediate Implementation (Phase 1)
- âœ… SQLAlchemy 2.0 async setup with asyncpg
- âœ… Alembic configuration for async migrations
- âœ… FastAPI dependency injection for database sessions
- âœ… Basic health check endpoints
- âœ… Environment-based configuration management

### Future Enhancement (Post-Foundation)
- ðŸ”„ PostgreSQL 18 UUIDv7 migration (when PG18 stable)
- ðŸ”„ RLS policy implementation (when business logic added)
- ðŸ”„ Advanced connection pooling tuning
- ðŸ”„ Database monitoring and observability

## Risk Mitigation

### PostgreSQL 18 Timeline Risk
- **Risk**: PostgreSQL 18 not ready for production deployment
- **Mitigation**: UUID4 fallback strategy, migration path planned
- **Impact**: Low - foundation works with any PostgreSQL version

### Async Complexity Risk
- **Risk**: Async/await patterns increase debugging complexity
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive error handling, health checks, clear logging
- **Impact**: Medium - development velocity may slow initially

### RLS Architecture Risk
- **Risk**: Foundation choices conflict with future RLS implementation
- **Mitigation**: Research-backed design decisions, flexible session management
- **Impact**: Low - patterns identified are RLS-compatible

## Next Phase Prerequisites

All research questions resolved. Ready to proceed to Phase 1 design with:
- Clear technology choices documented
- Implementation patterns identified
- Risk mitigation strategies established
- Future migration paths planned
