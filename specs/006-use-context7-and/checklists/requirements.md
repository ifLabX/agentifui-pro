# Specification Quality Checklist: Coze Python SDK Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **PASS** - No implementation details: The specification focuses on SDK integration testing without mentioning specific Python frameworks, test libraries, or implementation approaches beyond what's necessary for understanding the requirements.

✅ **PASS** - Focused on user value: All user stories clearly articulate value for developers integrating and testing the Coze SDK.

✅ **PASS** - Non-technical stakeholder clarity: While technical in nature (SDK testing), the specification is written in clear language that business stakeholders can understand the value and scope.

✅ **PASS** - Mandatory sections completed: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully filled out with concrete details.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers: All requirements are clearly specified with informed defaults based on the Dify SDK pattern and industry standards.

✅ **PASS** - Requirements are testable: All 20 functional requirements have clear, testable criteria (e.g., "MUST add cozepy package", "MUST create test directory structure").

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are measurable: All 8 success criteria include specific metrics (80% coverage, under 5 seconds execution, 30+ test cases, zero flaky tests).

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are technology-agnostic: While SDK-specific, criteria focus on outcomes (developers can install, tests pass, coverage achieved) rather than implementation details.

✅ **PASS** - All acceptance scenarios defined: Each of the 5 user stories includes 1-4 Given/When/Then scenarios covering the core functionality.

✅ **PASS** - Edge cases identified: 8 edge cases covering authentication failures, network errors, version conflicts, rate limiting, invalid IDs, stream interruptions, timeouts, and malformed data.

✅ **PASS** - Scope clearly bounded: Scope is limited to SDK integration testing following the Dify pattern, explicitly covers client initialization, bot operations, chat functionality, and workflows.

✅ **PASS** - Dependencies and assumptions: Comprehensive assumptions section covering Python version, testing framework, package manager, mock usage, and environment variable conventions.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - All functional requirements have acceptance criteria: The 20 functional requirements map to specific user stories with acceptance scenarios.

✅ **PASS** - User scenarios cover primary flows: 5 prioritized user stories cover the complete SDK integration journey from installation (P1) through advanced workflow testing (P4).

✅ **PASS** - Feature meets success criteria: The requirements and user scenarios directly support achieving all 8 measurable outcomes.

✅ **PASS** - No implementation leaks: The specification maintains focus on WHAT needs to be tested rather than HOW to implement the tests.

## Notes

**Specification Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

This specification is complete, well-structured, and ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`. All validation criteria have been met:

- Clear prioritization of user stories from P1 (foundation) to P4 (advanced features)
- Comprehensive functional requirements covering all aspects of SDK integration testing
- Measurable success criteria that can verify feature completion
- Well-defined edge cases for robust implementation
- Realistic assumptions based on project standards and the Dify SDK pattern

**Strengths**:
1. Follows established Dify SDK integration pattern for consistency
2. Clear progression from basic setup to advanced features
3. Strong emphasis on testing quality (80% coverage, zero flaky tests, mypy compliance)
4. Practical edge cases covering real-world integration challenges
5. Technology-agnostic success criteria focused on developer outcomes

**No blocking issues identified** - specification meets all quality standards.
