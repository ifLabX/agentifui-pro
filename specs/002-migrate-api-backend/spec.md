# Feature Specification: API Backend Directory Restructuring

**Feature Branch**: `002-migrate-api-backend`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Migrate API backend from flat layout to standard src/ directory structure while maintaining all existing functionality and test capability"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the Agentifui Pro API, I need the codebase to follow standard Python project structure (src layout) so that the project is easier to navigate, package, and maintain according to industry best practices, while ensuring all existing functionality continues to work without interruption.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the API backend currently uses flat directory layout, **When** the migration is complete, **Then** all project modules are organized under a src/ directory with proper package structure
2. **Given** the restructured codebase, **When** developers run dependency sync, **Then** all imports resolve correctly without errors
3. **Given** the restructured codebase, **When** developers run the test suite, **Then** all existing tests pass successfully
4. **Given** the restructured codebase, **When** developers start the API server, **Then** the application runs with all endpoints functional
5. **Given** configuration files that reference module paths, **When** the migration is complete, **Then** all tools (pytest, alembic, ruff, uvicorn) work correctly with the new structure
6. **Given** environment variable configuration, **When** tests are executed, **Then** the system reads configuration from .env file successfully

### Edge Cases
- What happens when existing .env file has user modifications that differ from .env.example?
- How does the system handle import path changes in migration scripts and database configurations?
- What happens if any hardcoded absolute paths exist in configuration files?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST reorganize all project modules (config, database, health, middleware, models, main) into a src/ directory structure
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain proper Python package structure with __init__.py files in all package directories
- **FR-003**: System MUST update all import statements to work correctly with the new src/ layout
- **FR-004**: System MUST configure package discovery to automatically find packages under src/ directory
- **FR-005**: System MUST update build system configuration to reference the new package structure
- **FR-006**: System MUST update all tool configurations (pytest, alembic, ruff, uvicorn) to work with src/ layout
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure environment variable configuration is properly set up and accessible
- **FR-008**: System MUST verify that dependency synchronization completes without import errors
- **FR-009**: System MUST verify that the test suite can discover and execute all tests
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve all existing functionality after migration
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve any user-modified configuration without data loss

### Key Entities
- **Project Modules**: Core application packages (config, database, health, middleware, models) that require relocation
- **Configuration Files**: Tool configurations (pyproject.toml, pytest, alembic, ruff) that require path updates
- **Environment Variables**: Application settings (DATABASE_URL, etc.) that must remain accessible
- **Package Structure**: Python package hierarchy with proper __init__.py files for imports
- **Build Configuration**: Package discovery settings for proper module resolution
