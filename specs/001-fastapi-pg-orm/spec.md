# Feature Specification: FastAPI Backend Architecture Foundation

**Feature Branch**: `001-fastapi-pg-orm`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Setup minimal FastAPI backend architecture with PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy ORM, and Alembic migrations. Focus on foundation structure following best practices, no business logic modules."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature clearly specified: minimal FastAPI backend architecture
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, future users
   ‚Üí Actions: set up foundation, prepare for RLS
   ‚Üí Data: PostgreSQL database structure
   ‚Üí Constraints: minimal, no business logic, best practices
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Development environment configuration requirements
   ‚Üí Database schema structure expectations
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer workflow scenarios identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on architecture capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities (foundational data structures)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Architecture requirements properly scoped
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT the backend architecture needs to provide and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (specific FastAPI patterns, SQLAlchemy configurations)
- üë• Written for technical leads and developers who need to understand the foundation

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer setting up a new project, I need a properly configured FastAPI backend foundation with PostgreSQL integration so that I can begin building business features without worrying about basic infrastructure setup.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh development environment, **When** the backend architecture is set up, **Then** the application should start successfully and connect to PostgreSQL
2. **Given** the backend is running, **When** database operations are needed, **Then** SQLAlchemy ORM should be properly configured and accessible
3. **Given** future schema changes are anticipated, **When** developers need to modify the database, **Then** Alembic migrations should be properly configured and functional
4. **Given** Row Level Security (RLS) will be needed later, **When** the database structure is established, **Then** the foundation should support RLS implementation without architectural changes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when database connection fails during startup?
- How does the system handle database migration conflicts?
- What occurs when environment variables are missing or invalid?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a FastAPI application foundation that starts successfully
- **FR-002**: System MUST establish and maintain PostgreSQL database connections
- **FR-003**: System MUST include SQLAlchemy ORM configuration for data access
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide Alembic migration framework for schema management
- **FR-005**: System MUST support environment-based configuration management
- **FR-006**: System MUST include proper error handling for database connectivity issues
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide logging configuration for development and debugging
- **FR-008**: System MUST include health check capabilities for application monitoring
- **FR-009**: System MUST support future Row Level Security (RLS) implementation without architectural changes
- **FR-010**: System MUST follow FastAPI and SQLAlchemy best practices for maintainability

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Database Connection**: Represents the PostgreSQL connection pool and session management
- **Migration State**: Tracks database schema versions and migration history through Alembic
- **Application Configuration**: Manages environment variables and application settings
- **Health Status**: Monitors application and database connectivity status
